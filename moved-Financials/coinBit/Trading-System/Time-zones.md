### BTC acitve hours and Time Zones 

- 4 PM PST ( SFO time) is  12:00 AM Start of new Crypto Trading day 
- coin desk Charts all ways point for UTC time
- UTC 1:30 AM  is China/Korea/Japn 9:30 AM, it makes lot of sense to start the day with Big 3 Crypto Markets/people
- Also by 4 PM PST (SPO) which is 7 PM EST ( New yourk) is also good way to **END the day** with crypto which alligns with 12:00 UTC

- It wasn't always so, [but since our China friends joined the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3yee6w/best_times_of_day_to_trade_btc/) at the end of 2013, **the big moves usually come in China timezone:**
```
I've seen a number of moves begin around this time, in anticipation of China waking up, up to 
23-2h UTC, 1:30 AM UTC being 9:30 AM Hong Kong/Shanghai/Shenzhen stock market opening hours.
actual market opening hours at 1:30 AM UTC.

Weekly futures settlement, especially OKCoin. There are often shenanigans before settlement and then the 
ripple effect of actual settlement.

I've also seen moves at a time when it's most inconvenient for me personally. :) I'm in European timezone, 
when I'm either going to work or back home. Although my commute takes minuscule 7 minutes something is bound to happen at that time,
at either 8 or 16h UTC. 

For example, big 15k BTC buy during 
slaying of bearwhale happened at precisely 8h UTC, just as I was planning to go long as soon as I get to computer.```
