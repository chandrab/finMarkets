### 1/ Charting UI for Trading
- It seems  Tradingview or coingly will do for all TA Indicators etc , **we may not need WEB UI ( lots of effort to develop),** instead pay $20/month and use it If you are a serious Trader .
- to plot nice 50, 100, 150 period Moving Avarage AM lines ( day or 4 hour, 1 hour period) lines 
- ATA Actual True Range ,  RSI , STOC 
- how many days( periods ) since touching 50, 100, 150 MA lines ( like Parabolic Trader mentioned ) . **For this table calc use Python , Pandas, Kaggle code programs**

```
Period  | # of Bars it took
------- | ---------------
 50      35
 100     60
 150     122

good review [TradingView Vs. Coinigy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/6n3630/tradingview_or_coinigy/)
```
I have been trying out both. For serious day-trading, I'd go with Coinigy because of the API-support and number of exchanges.

However, as a newbie-investor, I chose Trading View. Mostly because of the social aspect. You can view how other seasoned investors have done their analyses, comment on them, publish your own predictions and get feedback on them. This is great for learning. Also Trading View was a bit cheaper (a few dollars per month).

The downside of course is that you have to manually connect to the exchanges to make trades. Also you don't have an overview of how your whole portfolio is doing, like you would see on Coinigy.

As for ease of use and reliability, haven't had problems with either. There is a small bug in Coinigy however. If my browser cache has been cleared and I open up the site again, my basic view setting has reverted to default. I mean the color-scheme. All the indicators are on their place as should.
