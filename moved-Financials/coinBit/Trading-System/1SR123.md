### come up with 3 Supprot and Resistnace Lines S3, S2, S1, R1, R2, R3

```
0. Run simmulation mode for after backtest ( use Zipline or zenbot etc.. )
1. sim mode , send to friends for 30 days ( Raj , Dhaval, others )
3. then have a 40k accoutn 4k x 10 people and do it on  Interactive Brokers, do with CBOE XBT futures  which gives short sell for 40k , Long 9 K 
```

##### 1. find Support resistance BAND 

**1.1 Mean Shift**
- Meanshift is a clustering algorithm that assigns the datapoints to the clusters iteratively by shifting points towards the mode
- [article](http://www.chioka.in/meanshift-algorithm-for-the-rest-of-us-python/)  [code notebook](https://github.com/log0/build-your-own-meanshift/blob/master/Meanshift%20In%202D.ipynb)

**1.2 finding support resistance lines using MeanShift**
- [article](http://jon.io/machine-beats-human-using-machine-learning-in-forex.html) , [githubcode](https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading/blob/master/ml/ml.py)
- this uses skykitlearn Builtin MeanShift, above 1.1 Meanshift is developed their own implimentation of Meanshift

##### 2. asr own: find Support resistance BAND 
- have a genearl one for 5 minute bars or 20,30 minute bars
- 5 min bars, you have 12/hour , in 24 hours  24 x 12 =  288 ( close to 300 bars ). Then see how price is touching 100 bar, 200, 300 bars

- 15-minutebars [GBP/USD,  10, 20 EMA band as buffer zone](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/dynamic-support-and-resistance)Let’s take another look at that 15-minute chart of GBP/USD, but this time let’s use the 10 and 20 EMAs. for Resistance, in uptrend same will cats as SUPPORT band
- sr: find good  N minute bar, with  K1, K2 band that works in both uptrend and downtrend with Back testing  by suppling
- some ideas to get above BAND of 10,20 EMA 
```
N = [5, 7, 9, 11, 13] 
for n in N:
  K = [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  for k in K:
      k1, k2  = (n *k , n* (k+1) )
```
##### 3. google search Support Resistance algo 
- [good stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8587047/support-resistance-algorithm-technical-analysis)
 ```
 less complex algorithm in my algorithmic trading system. ( serach in above stackoverflow for these desc )

Break timeseries into segments of size N (Say, N = 5)
Identify minimum values of each segment, you will have an array of minimum values from all segments = :arrayOfMin
Find minimum of (:arrayOfMin) = :minValue
```
**implementning above algorithm**
```
def find_sup(price):
  support_points = []
  
  while len(price) > 1:
    min = min(price)
    sarr = []
    
    for ind, x in enumerate(price):
       diff = x - min 
       if ( diff < (min * 0.15) ):  # if difference is less than 1.5%  then consider this same 
          sarr.append(ind)   #  sarr holds Indices not values
  
    for i, ind in enumerate(sarr):
        sarr[i] = price[ind]   #  now sarr hold actual values
        del price[ind]  # delete original index as it is used already
        
    sarr.append(min) # all min manullay , it won't be added in above in the first loop ( coz diff == 0 )
    
    point = [ mean(sarr),  len(sarr)]  # support value & howmany bars at that level
    support_points.append(point)  

   return support_points  # hold list of support points 
```

- [algo mentioned above on it own page](https://kite.trade/forum/discussion/1047/a-simple-python-function-to-detect-support-resistance-levels
- This is derivatives based, local maxima, minima . when I ran with price.txt values , it give [] for support and one single value list for resistance , so NOT a Tested algorithm
```
def supres(ltp, n):
    """
    This function takes a numpy array of last traded price
    and returns a list of support and resistance levels 
    respectively. n is the number of entries to be scanned.
    """
    from scipy.signal import savgol_filter as smooth

    #converting n to a nearest even number
    if n%2 != 0:
        n += 1
    
    n_ltp = ltp.shape[0]

    # smoothening the curve
    ltp_s = smooth(ltp, (n+1), 3) 

    #taking a simple derivative
    ltp_d = np.zeros(n_ltp)
    ltp_d[1:] = np.subtract(ltp_s[1:], ltp_s[:-1])
 
    resistance = []
    support = []
    
    for i in xrange(n_ltp - n):
        arr_sl = ltp_d[i:(i+n)]
        first = arr_sl[:(n/2)] #first half
        last = arr_sl[(n/2):] #second half
        
        r_1 = np.sum(first > 0)
        r_2 = np.sum(last < 0)

        s_1 = np.sum(first < 0)
        s_2 = np.sum(last > 0)

        #local maxima detection
        if (r_1 == (n/2)) and (r_2 == (n/2)): 
            resistance.append(ltp[i+((n/2)-1)])

        #local minima detection
        if (s_1 == (n/2)) and (s_2 == (n/2)): 
            support.append(ltp[i+((n/2)-1)])

    return support, resistance
    ```
