 Examples of Using the Zacks Rank
1. In the summer of 2017 , Ichor Holdings ICHR went from a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) and sank quickly to a Zacks #4 (Sell), 
      moved to a #3 (Hold) and is now a #1 (Strong Buy) again. How can a stock go from a #1 to a #4 the next day?

2. Oclaro OCLR was a #3 (Hold) for a couple of months until it dropped to a #4 (Sell) in August. Why the drop 
    and what are the estimates telling us?

3. Amazon AMZN has been a #5 (Strong Sell) several times this year. How can it be a Strong Sell when the 
  stock has been moving higher?
