#### Some good Trading Poings.


1/ 10 things I wish someone had [told me when I was learning to trade crypto (self.Bitcoin)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/#bottom-comments)

2/ [What are the different Types of Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/dr1wfd5/)

- **Trading is not about predicting massive events like a crash or huge upswing**, trading is about **making money without losing money when these events do occur**. 

- **Trading 4 types** : a) providing liquidity to a market (for which the market "pays you) 

 b) exacting a "volatility tax" on the market <br>
 c) short term Speculation ( holding couple of days/weeks, anticipating an EVENT to Occur ) -- Predicing an Event <br>
 d) investment : Buy and hold for months/years to appreciate <br>
 
 - In fact this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to "trade". I like to think of **trading as one of two things: either providing liquidity to a market (for which the market "pays you), or as a way of exacting a "volatility tax" on the market. 

- You should never be left "holding the bag", so to speak, because your trading strategy should guarantee (or guarantee with some high probability) that this won't affect you negatively much, if at all.

- Are you advocating holding cryptos over the course of several days? That's not really trading, that's more in the realm of "short term investment" or more broadly "speculation". 

- When trading, the more volatility of something, the less time you want to hold it (and also the less time it takes to make money off it via trading anyway). 

- **I view trading as exploiting volatility between market events** - if you hold on to something for long enough for market events to occur, you're trying to make money off of those events and the volatility. 

- In general predicting events is a lot harder than Preidcting volatility - it definitely can be done, and you can make money off of it, but it requires a completely different set of skills than trading does.
