Zillow's business model
Zillow Group is a technology-powered residential real estate advertising company. Unlike Redfin it does not employ 
local real estate agents. Instead, it looks upon real estate agents, mortgage brokers, and contractors as customers
who will advertise on its various branded sites.

From a business model perspective, these two companies are very different. 
Redfin is an operating real estate brokerage company that is also interested in title insurance and mortgages and Zillow 
is primarily an advertising company. 

Both are using technology and consumer access to the internet to disrupt the traditional residential real estate industry.

2/ Redfin
-----------
Redfin's competition is local real estate companies doing business all over America. It is currently located in over 80
different markets around the country and employed almost 800 lead agents as of the end of 2016.

Reduced commission. 
----------
In a standard transaction of a house sale, there is a total of 6% commissionwith half going to the seller's agent 
and the other 3% to the buyer's agent. 

Redfin charges on average 1.5% for the listing, the seller then pays the other 3% to the buying office, 
constituting a saving of 1.5%. 

Redfin rebates buyers, in states where rebates are allowed, on average about $3,500 when the buyer uses a Redfin agent.
