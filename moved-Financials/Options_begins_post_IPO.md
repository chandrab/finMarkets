 S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm, believes early investors could sell up to 120 million shares starting 
  on July 31 in SNAP Stock, increasing the supply for short sellers who are currently paying annualized 
  interest rates of more than 60 percent to borrow the stock.
  
But experts said lockup expiries tend to hurt companies already on weak footing.
 -------------------
 - Twitter Inc shares dropped 18 percent on the day of a key lockup expiry in May 2014. 
 - In November 2012, Facebook Inc jumped 13 percent the day of a lockup expiry after its IPO.


  
  "The stock borrow rates will plummet very quickly," said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 Partners' head of research. 
  "You've got a lot of short sellers that didn't like the trade at a 50 percent fee, but love it at a 5 percent fee."
  
  Following its recent share price decline ( being SNAP at $14 ) Snap is valued at 16 times expected revenue , 
   still expensive compared to Facebook at 12 times revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Nearly 365,000 Facebook options contracts changed hands on the first day of their listing, 
a record for a new listing, per options analytics firm Trade Alert.

"Technology stocks, especially social media stocks, are the kind of companies that really draw a lot of activity from options traders," said David Russell, senior manager at online broker E*Trade Financial Corp (ETFC.O) in Chicago.

Since newly issued stocks have a limited number of shares that can be borrowed for shorting purposes, increased shorting demand can lead to a scarcity of shares available for borrowing and also drive up the cost of borrowing.
